The condition of your roof and gutters can make a big difference in the overall look of your home. A clean, well-maintained roof will improve curb appeal and protect your home from potential damage. Regularly inspect your roof for missing shingles, leaks, or debris. Has it been cleaned and repaired by professionals, if necessary, to maintain its integrity? Your gutters should also be clean and free of leaves or clogs to prevent water damage and ensure they are working properly. A well-maintained roof and clean gutters are not always the most visible features of curb appeal, but they do contribute to the overall aesthetic and long-term value of a home.
